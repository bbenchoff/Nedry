# Nedry
 Remember Jurassic Park? Remember the, "Ah Ah Ah! You didn't say the magic word!" animation that plays when Samuel L. Jackson tries to undo Newman's hacking? It's that. It's just a small little program that plays that animation over and over.

This is my first 'real' attempt at targeting the classic ( < OS 9 ) Macintosh OS. It's a small application that simply plays the 'Ah Ah Ah! You didn't say the magic word!" animation from Jurassic Park.

This was developed with Metrowerks CodeWarrior Professional 4 in C. There's not really much to the code -- check out Nedry.c for the complete source. Of course, Nedry.rsrc is necessary to compile, because you need a resource fork for everything.

If you want to run this, simply download the NedryInstaller.sit file, decompress, and install. This will install a folder on a drive with the Nedry application and a Quicktime video. Quicktime is necessary to install, and the installer should quit if Quicktime is not installed in your system folder.

There's also an 'About' dialog box in the Apple menu:
